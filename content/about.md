## Hello from Brooklyn!

Follow along as we tell the story of our family and our old house as we work to remove all fossil fuels from our home and life. We will be renovating, electrifying everything, and optimizing our solar panel energy usage to achieve net zero living. (Producing as much solar energy in the year as we use in our home.) Is it possible? We think so, but we have a lot to learn!
